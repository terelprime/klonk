- UNDO TO LAST FLIP!
- File delete
- File rename/move
- Command window
  "find -help" gives java.lang.RuntimeException: You appear to be missing a trailing " character

- File save as should that remove encryption?

-OSX: Why is openfileList even there? I never use it.
-OSX: Supposedly the java scrollbar jitter problem is fixed
-OSX: Option-backspace causes undo buffer failure
-OSX: tabs at beginning of line screws with using mouse to place cursor. it lands to the left of target.
-OSX: Need alternate keys for shift-ctrl-f9 and shift ctrl f12? You could toss in an option keypress.
-Fixed?
  OSX HELP Window scrolls like crap, like edit window used to
  OSX Update Help to indicate F11 alternatives

-Current

  -Get better performance by creating a NEW Document during load instead of using the one that's in the JTextArea. This apparently causes a lot of overhead otherwise.
    -It is also suggested that one add content to a list of ElementSpecs and then insert in one monster operation.
      http://javatechniques.com/blog/faster-jtextpane-text-insertion-part-ii/
      Note that we already do something similar, although we use a 64K buffer.

  -What is this Ctrl-W thing in Editor.java? This is dumb. Maybe not

  -Shell
    -Losing your command because you forgot to shut down the previous command and when you do bam the current one is gone. Sucks.
    -We should be able to make the shell textbox act like our normal editor using our Selectable class.

  -Cursor does not move with mousewheel, only with page down.

  -File open ought to start off the session with the last directory opened.
   It's annoying when it defaults to my stupid home directory.
   But make sure to avoid SSH dirs.

-Hard
  -Load file & Find/replace are abusive. Fix them.
    -Load file ought to be able to find out about LF/CR/CRLF after the fact. Or just read a few lines. I don't know.

  -When I switch windows the cursor position frequently goes somewhere else

  -How about dual-window mode. Only two windows, that's it.

-Maybe
  -Hey and a menu item for File-Delete? With confirm of course. Hmph.

  -SSH Todo:
    Alt-f-d doesn't work with ssh and needs to be disabled.
    Sudo
    Single quotes in the filename are a bit of a problem, and double quotes, and whatever else.
    When we disconnect the network the ssh session doesn't know.
      We could do Session.sendKeepAliveMsg or Session.sendIgnore
    What about when a host key changes or is missing? Will we blow up?

  -Maybe a more sophisticated version of find/replace, where I break up the String? It is pretty slow on an 8MB file.
    -Loop thru 20000 characters at a time, appending last searchFor.length() from previous to first.
    -Note that java.util.regex.Matcher does have the ability to tell you that the end of a string is a partial match.
  -About should show an icon
  -Undo
    -Undo to last save?
    -You could have undostep include whether selection is forwards or backwards. Just a boolean.
  -Selected text color, selected background color
  -Indents & Tabs, Fonts should only enable ok button when something changes.

  -We ought to make it where you can pick between fixed-width and not fixed-width fonts in the picker.
    FontRenderContext frc = new FontRenderContext(
      null, RenderingHints.VALUE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_DEFAULT, RenderingHints.VALUE_FRACTIONALMETRICS_DEFAULT
    );
    for (Font font : fonts) {
        Rectangle2D iBounds = font.getStringBounds("i", frc);
        Rectangle2D mBounds = font.getStringBounds("m", frc);
        if (iBounds.getWidth() == mBounds.getWidth()) {
            monoFonts1.add(font);
        }
    }

-On hold / Long term problems
  -Weird background bugs
    -Do you see that doo doo where java says it's starting up with mixed mode "sharing"?
    -Mostly when it runs two at once.

  -Exe alternatives?
    -Consider jexepack, which costs $100 or you get an alert everytime you open it.
    -javapackager seems to only create an annoying installer and you have to install a second thing.

  -Slow scrolling:
    -Too many key listeners?
    -Noticed that it seems to slow down with a lot of windows open. Hmph. Don't tell me I have to resort to... oh gawd no. Not recreating jtextareas when I switch windows. Horrors.

  -OSX Jitter: This is known. One suggested fix was trying to prevent horizontal events by consuming them but apparently this didn't help.
    https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8147994

  -OSX:Consider using the default java runtime and shrinking the deploy (leave after the = blank): -Bruntime=
    Didn't work. Couldn't find java when I did this.

-Fixed?
  -New Klonk Bug - I have a fix in place per the ideas offered on stacko:
  Also consider the idea offered at bottom of this page:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6436944/java-illegalstateexception-buffers-have-not-been-created
